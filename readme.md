# 42 Philosophers

## Overview
Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:<br>
• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.<br>
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.<br><br>
• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.<br>
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;<br>
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;<br>
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.<br><br>
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.<br><br>
• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.<br><br>
• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.<br><br>
• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.<br><br>
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.<br><br>
• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.<br><br>
• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!<br>
